# Anaemia Prediction
This project focuses on predicting anaemia based on various pixel-based features of red blood cell images and hemoglobin (Hb) levels. The dataset used for this project, the Anemia Detection Dataset, contains data on pixel values (Red, Green, Blue) and Hb levels, along with the target variable "Anaemic" that classifies whether a person is anaemic ("Yes" or "No"). The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting anaemia from the given features. Several machine learning algorithms, including Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Random Forests (RF), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), were evaluated using cross-validation and bootstrapping techniques. The best-performing model was saved and deployed as an API using the Plumber package, enabling real-time anaemia predictions. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning to medical data, showcasing how pixel-based image data can be used for health-related predictions.
